    The program is very intuitive and easy to navigate but for starters the interface is going to ask you to choose between 1 and 2, 1 being to "browse an edit" recepies already saved in your cookbook and the second option being the "create" a new recepie.
    If you choose the first option it is going to then ask you different questions in order for it to continue working the program, since this program doesn't use a folder you need to scroll a little bit up in order to see the recepie you just browsed.
    If you choose the second option once again it is going to ask you for the ingredients and the level fo difficulty you want for your recepie, once again since this program does not use a folder you gottaq scroll a little bit in order to see the recepie and it's going to ask if you want to save or delete your recepuie.
 
 END OF THE PROGRAM.
